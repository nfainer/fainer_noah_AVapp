1
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.120
You were made to be ruled.

2
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.360
It will be every man for himself.

3
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.680
What do we do? We get ready.

4
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.320
There was an idea.

5
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.840
To bring together a

6
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.800
group of remarkable people.

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.560
So when we needed them.

8
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.760
They could fight the battles, but we
never could.

9
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080
What are you prepared to do?

10
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.600
No offense, but I don't play well with
others.

11
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.640
Big man in a suit armor.
Take that away.

12
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.400
What are you, a genius?

13
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Billionaire playboy philanthropist.

14
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Damn shirt, avenger.

15
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.640
Dr.

16
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.240
Bennett, your work is unparalleled, and
I'm a huge

17
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.600
fan of the way you lose control and turn
into an enormous green rage monster.
