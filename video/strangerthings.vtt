00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.360
On Halloween night we all saw a sort of shadow.

2
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Maybe all this

3
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
is happening for a reason.

4
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.680
These are not nightmares. Its Happening.

5
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.960
it all leads back to here.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
what is wrong with my boy?

6
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.960
We does he want?

7
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.400
if anyone knows how to destroy this thing. its will.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.400
Do you think it's weird how only

8
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
seem to hang out when the world's about
to end?


00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
its not like it was before. its grown.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
which is why we need as much help as we can get.

9
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.760
You should go now.

10
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.960
So let's hear.

11
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.240
You still have that bat? What bat?
the one with the nails.
