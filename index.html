                <p>Don't believe everything happiness says.
                    Nothing feels better than hiding these days.
                    We bury our fears in the drinks in these tears
                    For the days we believed we could fly.
                    Call up your brothers and sisters and friends
                    We'll go back to the place where the night never ends.
                    We'll remember the fires,
                    The burning car tires.
                    Boy how in the hell'd we get here?</p>


                <p>
                    So why don't you meet me down behind our old school
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how cavalier we used to be
That beautiful insanity the apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade, away
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over and over and over again
We sat down for a minute grew up into men
Now we're putting out fires and changing car tires
Man how in the hell'd we get here?
                </p>

                <p>
                    So why don't you meet me down behind our old school
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how cavalier we used to be
That beautiful insanity the apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade, away
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time
And we'll never get back what we gave away
When we stare at the fire in our eyes
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't believe everything happiness says
Nothing's as real as our old reckless ways
When we drink by the fires the burning car tires
Bad girls and good liars, the dreams we conspired
The days we went crazy, the nights wild and hazy
Man how in the hell'd we get here?
                </p>

                <p>
                    So why don't you meet me down behind our old school
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how cavalier we used to be
That beautiful insanity the apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade, away
                </p>
